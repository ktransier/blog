In 2018 I set a goal to workout for at least 30 minutes every day of the year. By December 31st I had learned an incredible amount about the physical and mental benefits of consistent training, whether it was running a marathon or the 30 minutes of yoga I did the next day.
	
I started building [Endurance](https://endurancegoals.app/) based on that experience of setting a consistent training plan and sticking to it. It's an iOS app that allows you to set weekly goals, plan future workouts and encourages you to create streaks of consistent training. The app has support for multiple different types of activities, starting with running, cycling, lifting and yoga and allows you to enter upcoming races to plan for.

I'll be iterating and improving this app over this next year and would love feedback on what others are looking for in a training application focused on endurance activities. Next I'm planning to work on the ability to share training plans, syncing from Apple Health and logging nutrition goals.
