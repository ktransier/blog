In January I joined [The Resolve](http://theresolve.org) - a humanitarian advocacy organization - as a Legislative Fellow. As a Legislative Fellow I'm responsible for leading meetings with Foreign Affairs staff in the House of Representatives to advocate for the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act.
