Starting in August of 2010, I hitchhiked 2000km+ across the North and South Islands of New Zealand over the course of 4 months, working on farms, doing carpentry work, and learning how to horsetrek in the shadow of Mt. Doom. I trekked on 2 of New Zealand's Great Walks, the Heaphy and Abel Tasman Tracks on the southern island. In the last month I bungee jumped from the Nevis Platform in Queenstown, freefalling for 7 seconds. More stories to come.
