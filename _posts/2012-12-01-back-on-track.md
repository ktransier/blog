I designed and laid out Getting Back on Track (English/French), a report sponsored by 10 human rights organizations providing detailed recommendations to the U.N. Security Council on ending the threat of the Lord's Resistance Army. *Coverage: [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/dec/18/ngo-un-kony-lords-resistance-army)*
