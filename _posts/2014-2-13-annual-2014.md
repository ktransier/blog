The [@crisistracker](http://twitter.com/crisistracker) team has published the [2013 LRA Crisis Tracker Annual Security Brief](http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013), analyzing LRA activity and the continued international response to the crisis. With Paul on writing and analysis, and myself on design, visuals and mapping we've worked hard for the last two months to really drill down into the data the [@invisible](http://twitter.com/invisible) team has collected from the early warning network in DRC and CAR. With Margaux on further data analysis, and Saskia and Maree on the French translation we had a great team contribute to the report.

Major takeaways from the report include:

1. Ugandan male combatants, comprising the core of the LRA's fighting force and command structure, lost significant numbers with up to 20% killed or captured over the course of 2013.

2. Instability in Seleka controlled areas of CAR has created a lifeline for the LRA, where AU-RTF troops in pursuit of Kony have limited reach and LRA mass attacks have increased.

3. LRA violence has dropped in DRC for the fourth consecutive year, with a 44% reduction in abductions from 2012. When comparing 2008-2010 with the years 2011-2013, LRA killings in DRC have dropped 94%.

The report extends my work last year to push the reporting from a PDF to a primarily web format. The report is built on [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/) for templating and uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for base styling. I designed the underlying basemap in [QuantumGIS](http://www.qgis.org/) and then uploaded to [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com). Datasets were then overlaid and embedded with [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/). Visuals were built with [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/).

We've had a great response from policymakers and our partners on the ground, and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations spread the word of the report here:
