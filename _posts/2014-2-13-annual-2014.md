[Paul](http://twitter.com/pauldronan) and I are proud to publish the [2013 LRA Crisis Tracker Annual Security Brief](http://reports.lracrisistracker.com/en/annual-2013). With Paul on writing and analysis, and myself on design, visuals and mapping we've worked hard for the last two months to really drill down into the data the [@invisible](http://twitter.com/invisible) team has collected from the early warning network in DRC and CAR.

The report extends my work last year to push the reporting from a PDF to a primarily web format. The report is built on [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/) for templating and uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for base stlying. I designed the underlying basemap in [QuantumGIS](http://www.qgis.org/) and then uploaded to [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com). Datasets were then overlaid and embedded with [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/). Visuals were built with [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/).
