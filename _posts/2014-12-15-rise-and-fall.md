title: The Rise and Fall of Donate for iPhone
category: blog
---

On November 8th, I made the initial git commit for Donate for iPhone, my first app for iOS. The idea was to build an app that enabled donors to give to a hand-selected list of non-profits through ApplePay.

I find that when learning a new language or platform, it's best to start with a simple tutorial and then jump immediately into a project you're interested in building. It keeps you motivated and immediately thrusts you into real-world challenges. I started with the series of lessons through Bitfountain's [The Complete iOS 8 Course with Swift](http://bitfountain.io/course/complete-ios8/) an incredibly up-to-date series using Swift and Xcode 6. When learning iOS, it's essential to start tutorials

Early on in the project, I switched from Swift to Objective-C and started over from scratch. This was due to a bug in Stripe's iOS library preventing loading the library in a Swift project. This has since been fixed, but in the meantime, it got me working on the project with Objective-C, which was a huge win in the longterm. As [outlined](http://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/ios-developers-need-to-know-objective-c/) by Big Nerd Ranch, future iOS developers need a strong background in Objective C.

Going into this project, I knew that there could possibly be challenges getting through the App Store approval process, especially since ApplePay only became officially available in October. However, I failed to consider that the core ability of the app would be against App Store guidelines. After getting the app to a good enough state that I felt comfortable submitting for TestFlight Beta Review, I uploading a build and hit submit. The next day I received a crushing email from the App Store review team. "Your app has been rejected for distribution through Appleâ€™s TestFlight Program because it does not comply with one or more App Store Review Guidelines: 21.2: The collection of charitable donations must be done via a web site in Safari or an SMS."

While I strongly disagree with this policy, this was entirely a blunder on my part. What I come to learn after further research is that this has been a significant problem for nonprofits over the last four years, with a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/technology/09charity.html) and a high-profile company, Paypal, [being forced by Apple](http://gizmodo.com/5703765/why-does-apple-make-being-a-charitable-app-so-hard) to remove their in-app donation policy.

Always read the entire [Apple Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) before starting a project. If you're doing something that would push the boundaries of any of the guidelines, do a search to see if anyone else has had difficulty with the review process. Get a prototype up and running fast, then submit to TestFlight Beta Review, to catch any early problems with App Store Guidelines
