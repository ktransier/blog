I've worked as a core team member on the conceptual development, launch and management of the LRA Crisis Tracker, a real-time crisis mapping application aggregating data of attacks by the Lordâ€™s Resistance Army on civilians from 80 early-warning HF radios in DR Congo and CAR. I've also led a 3-person team in developing the database schema, codebook, and data quality control of the seed attack dataset.

*Coverage: [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15173291), [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/1785098/cybermapping-africas-strangest-conflict), [iRevolution](http://irevolution.net/2011/09/29/real-time-lra-crisis-map-tracks-mass-atrocities-in-central-africa/)*
