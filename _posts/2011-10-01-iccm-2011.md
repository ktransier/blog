Participated in the 2011 International Conference on Crisis Mapping in Geneva, Switzerland with the Crisis Tracker team. 

Following the conference Michael, Chelsea John and I traveled to Paris on the train for some much needed R&R. Stayed in the Latin Quarter in the aptly named Young and Happy hostel.

In a couple short days saw the Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, Louvre Tour, Notre Dame and Basilique du Sacre-Coeur, took a tour on the Seine and ate at [Le Café Constant](http://www.yelp.com/biz/café-constant-paris-2).
