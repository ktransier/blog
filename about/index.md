<div class="post-title">About</div>

Hi! I’m Kenneth Transier. I am a product-focused software engineer versed in both web and mobile development based in Seattle, WA. Here’s some of the things I’ve built:

* Led the development of Blue Bottle Coffee’s [flagship iOS application](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/mobile-app), working to build the technical roadmap, architect the iOS client and launch to all cafes in the U.S. within 6 months
	
* Built the [Crisis Tracker](https://crisistracker.org/map), a real-time crisis mapping application run by Invisible Children, broadcasting attacks by the Lord’s Resistance Army on civilians from 75 early-warning radios in central Africa
	
* Led the launch of the [Beer Scanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tavour/id956371806), a machine learning initiative from Tavour that aimed to make searching for a craft beer 10x faster using label recognition. Worked to integrate MLModels with a React Native frontend and developed a method of generating synthetic beer label images that opened the door to 90% recognition of all beers in the U.S.
