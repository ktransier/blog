<div class="post-title">About</div>

Hi! I'm Kenneth Transier, a programmer and cartograher working to improve the intersection of technology and human rights.

For the past four years I've been building tools and solving problems for Resolve, a research and advocacy NGO based in D.C. With Resolve I helped build the LRA Crisis Tracker a real-time crisis mapping application aggregating data of attacks by the Lordâ€™s Resistance Army on civilians from 80 early-warning HF radios in DRC and CAR.

In 2013-2014 I worked for Fifty & Fifty building Donately, a donations platform startup. There I lead engineering of the project as we launched out of beta and I oversaw the platform as it processed over $1M in donations in the first year.

Currently I'm a senior at the University of Washington earning a degree in Political Science, with a focus in International Security. I choose Political Science because I'm curious about the ways in which power is abused, corrupted, bent, broken, balanced, manipulated and transformed. Maybe most of all I'm interested in how it's channeled for social good.
