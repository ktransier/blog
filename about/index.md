Hi! I'm Kenneth Transier, a full stack developer working to improve the intersection of technology and human rights. Currently I work for [Resolve](http://theresolve.org) building the [LRA Crisis Tracker](http://lracrisistracker.com) and I'm finishing up my degree in Political Science at the University of Washington here in Seattle.

You can reach me at
