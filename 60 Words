Incredible [reporting](http://www.radiolab.org/story/60-words/) from Radiolab and Buzzfeed on the legacy of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. A reminder that we cannot let emotions override our decision-making in the aftermath of great tragedy. 

Here's Barbara Lee's [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh_sxilhyV0) on the floor of the House on September 14, 2001. The vote was 95-0 in the Senate, and 420-1 in the House.

In an [interview](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2001/09/alone-hill) 9 days after the attack, Lee said, "I think that there's going to be a rush to judgment on civil liberties, and a clamping down, a suspension of our democratic rights. And I believe that those who are good Americans would want to see this not happen and that we debate how to find a balance between the public safety and the protection of civil liberties. But if you have a five-hour debate, a rush to judgment, on a bill that Attorney General [John] Ashcroft puts forward, and you don't give the Congress any political support to oppose that or to provide ways to ensure this balance, you're in for a very scary period. We've got to be vigilant."

How right she was.
