[Co-led the Oklahoma Holdout](/portfolio/holdout), an 11 day vigil seeking the release of Senator Tom Coburn's hold on the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act. The Holdout broke the last barrier of passage for the most cosponsored-piece of Africa related legislation in at least 37 years, marking the way for a [public signing ceremony](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/06/01/a-future-greater-security-and-hope-people-central-africa) by President Obama and the first public statement on the LRA by a U.S. President in the 25 year history of the conflict. *Coverage: [Daily Kos](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/03/09/844550/-Breaking-160-Sen-Coburn-Caves-OK-Students-Win), [Think Progress](http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2010/03/04/196391/coburn-obstructionism-boosting-lords-resistance-army/?mobile=nc), [Politico](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0310/Coburn_and_Uganda.html?showall), [the Oklahoman](http://newsok.com/tom-coburn-asked-to-end-block-on-uganda-bill/article/3442606?custom_click=pod_lead_politics)*
